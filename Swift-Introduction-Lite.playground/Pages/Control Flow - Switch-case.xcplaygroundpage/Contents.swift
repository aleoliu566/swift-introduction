 # Control Flow

 Control flow statements are used to change the execution order of lines of code.

 Swift provides a variety of control flow statements. These include `while` loops to perform a task multiple times;
 `if`, `guard`, and `switch` statements to execute different branches of code based on certain conditions;
 and statements such as `break` and `continue` to transfer the flow of execution to another point in your code.

 Swift also provides a `for-in` loop that makes it easy to iterate over arrays,
 dictionaries, ranges, strings, and other sequences.

 ## Switch
 
 A switch statement considers a value and compares it against several possible matching patterns. 
 It then executes an appropriate block of code, based on the first pattern that matches successfully.
 A switch statement provides an alternative to the if statement for responding to multiple potential states.

 In its simplest form, a switch statement compares a value against one or more values of the same type.

 This aboce `switch` statement **does not** have a default case.
 
 The final case, `case let (x, y)`, declares a tuple of two placeholder 
 constants that can match any value. Because `point` is always
 a tuple of two values, this case matches all possible remaining 
 values, and a default case is not needed to make the switch statement exhaustive.
